# Setting up Vagrant

If you don't have vagrant yet, you can start downloading it from [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

Download vagrant box by running the command:

`vagrant init hashicorp/precise32`

On your project directory, you should be able to run `vagrant up` successfully.
If so, you are ready to start working on your vagrant machine.

Start running `vagrant ssh`.

Once it's done, you can run: 

`cd /vagrant/` & `npm install`

And finally you should be able to start your app by running:

`node .`

Check if your app is running on `http://localhost:4567`
